# Seed-REST-Server-JEE7
This is a sample REST service based on JEE7.
 
 ![status](https://travis-ci.org/AllanHoejgaardJensen/seed-rest-server-jee7.svg?branch=master)  

## Deployment
The sample has two very simple concepts - "account" and customer" - which is assembled into one deployable war file.
Databases are separate to illustrate two different services. Normally they would be deployed as two different deployable units.

Useful Commands
---------------

To build the whole project:

    mvn package

To build project including running integration tests:

    mvn verify

To run in Wildfly:

    mvn -N -Pwildfly cargo:run

The WebLogic console may be accessed from http://localhost:7001/console using username "weblogic" and password "weblogic1".
The JBoss console may be accessed from http://localhost:9990 using username "advisor1" and password "passw0rd".

Inspiration

The code here is inspired heavily by work done by Nykredit on REST services.
